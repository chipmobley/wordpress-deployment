Capistrano script I use for deploying changes/themes/plugins/updates across several Wordpress multisite setups I run.  It allows me to easily ensure that all setups are the same. 

Requires:
Ruby
Capistrano Multistage ( sudo gem install capistrano-ext )
Railsless Deploy ( sudo gem install railsless-deploy -s http://gemcutter.org )

To Setup:
'/config/deploy' contains the configs for the servers you want to deploy to.  Edit them to suit your needs.
[ More to add... ]

To Use:
In this setup there are three servers, deptest, sites, test-cv. To run do 'cap server-name update:start'. for example:
cap deptest update:start
