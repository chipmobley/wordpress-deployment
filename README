Capistrano script I use for deploying changes/themes/plugins/updates across several Wordpress multisite setups I run.  It allows me to easily ensure that all setups are the same. 

Requires:
Ruby
Capistrano Multistage ( sudo gem install capistrano-ext )
Railsless Deploy ( sudo gem install railsless-deploy -s http://gemcutter.org )

To Setup:
'/config/deploy' contains the configs for the servers you want to deploy to.  Edit them to suit your needs.

You will need a wp-config.php file and a wordpress database.

To Use:
To run do 'cap server-name update:start'. for example:
cap deptest update:start

This script deploys the wordpress files to the location specified in the configs.  Move over the wp-config.php and point apache to the deploy folder and everything should work.
