Displays a badge showing your online reviews from Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yelp, CitySearch and Foursquare.

== Description ==

The myReviewsPage WordPress plugin for small businesses creates a badge to display on your website. 

It calls the APIs for Yelp, Yahoo, Bing, Citysearch and Foursquare via the [myReviewsPage](http://www.myreviewspage.com/blog/) myReviewsPage.com service and displays the number of online reviews for each on your website.

Some features include: 

* Automatically find and display your online reviews from your Google Places Page, Yahoo Local listing, Yelp, Bing, CitySearch and Foursquare.
* Display badge on any page or post on your WordPress website.
* Get email alerts when you receive a new online review (optional.)
* Optionally omit any of the review services from your badge.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need help with the installation - how do I install the plugin? =

You can find detailed installation instructions with screenshots here: http://www.myreviewspage.com/blog/wordpress-plugin/

= Why would I want to put this badge on my website? =

This is a good way to encourage customers to leave you online reviews. It also shows that you are being transparent about your online reviews (i.e. not just asking your favorites to leave them.) 

= I know I have reviews in Google/Yelp/Yahoo but they are not showing up in the badge! =

Sometimes the API for the review site might not return the correct business, especially if you have duplicate listings in that service. If your reviews do not show up, you can go into settings and override the URL for that service with the one you want to use. Then your reviews should show up in the badge. 

= The badge is not working for my country =

Many of the review service APIs are only returning results for U.S. based businesses. We are monitoring them and will add support for other countries as they become available in the APIs.
